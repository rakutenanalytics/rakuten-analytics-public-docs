## Creating a custom tracker

Custom trackers can be added to the manager.

Create a class and implement the `AnalyticsTracker` protocol. Its `process(event:state:)` method will receive an event with a name and parameters, and a state with attributes automatically generated by the SDK.

The custom tracker in the code sample below only prints a few diagnostic messages. A real custom tracker would upload data to a server.

```swift
public class CustomTracker: NSObject, AnalyticsTracker {
    public static let MyEventName = "customtracker.myeventname"
    public func process(event: AnalyticsManager.Event, state: AnalyticsManager.State) -> Bool {
        switch event.name {
        case AnalyticsManager.Event.Name.initialLaunch:
            print("I've just been launched!")
            return true
        case AnalyticsManager.Event.Name.login:
            print("User with tracking id '\(state.userid)' just logged in!")
            return true
        case MyEventName:
            print("Received my event!")
            return true
        // ...
        }

        // Unknown event
        return false
    }
}
```

The custom tracker can then be added to the `RAnalyticsManager`:

```swift
// Add CustomTracker to the manager
RAnalyticsManager.shared().add(CustomTracker())

// Tracking events can now be sent to the custom tracker
AnalyticsManager.Event(name: CustomTrackerMyEventName, parameters: nil).track()
```

### Installation

```
$ npm
```

### Local Development

## Yarn
```
yarn install
```
## npm
```
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

## Yarn
```
yarn build
```
## npm
```
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

### Production Preview

## Yarn 
```
yarn serve
```
## npm
```
npm run serve
```

This command serves the static site generated from `build` directory. Before running this command, you need to build the website.
